    Our Story
  </h1>
    <p>
       Founded over 20 years ago by Dr. Tonya Fowler Fordham, our practice was created to keep our rural community healthy and thriving. Dr. Fordham has always believed that quality healthcare 
       should be available to people from all walks of life, and she has dedicated her career to caring for the families of this community.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Our Philosophy
    </h2>
    <p>
        As a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), Dr. Fordham practices family medicine with a holistic approach — treating the whole person, not just the symptoms. We strive to listen, understand, 
        and support every patient, ensuring care is delivered with compassion and respect.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Our Services  
    </h2>
    <p>
        We provide comprehensive family medicine for patients of all ages. From preventive care and chronic condition management to women’s health and wellness visits, we are here to care 
        for the entire family. While not an urgent care clinic, we are committed to being here when our patients truly need us.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Our Community
    </h2>
    <p>
        Generations of families have trusted us with their care, and it’s our privilege to continue serving this community with dedication and kindness. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, 
        we adapted by creating a drive-thru triage system so patients could still receive safe, timely care. That experience reminded us that true compassion means being there for our community, no matter the challenge.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Our Future
    </h2>
    <p>
        While rooted in decades of experience, we are also looking forward — integrating AI and modern technology to improve efficiency, streamline care, and make every patient’s experience smoother and more satisfying.

        Dr. Tonya Fowler Fordham, DO – Family Medicine
    </p>
    <p>
        Born  Hazlehurst, Georgia and raised in the small town of Uvalda, Georgia, Dr. Tonya Fowler Fordham founded Doctors of Compassionate Services to care for the families in her community. She earned her Doctor 
        of Osteopathic Medicine degree from the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, and for over 20 years has dedicated her career to providing compassionate, whole-person care to patients of all ages. Dr. 
        Fordham’s philosophy is simple: medicine should heal both body and spirit. Known for saying that “saltwater heals everything,” she brings that same sense of calm and renewal into her beach-themed practice, 
        creating an environment where patients feel at ease. She chose medicine out of a genuine desire to help the people around her, and her approach reflects that calling — blending osteopathic principles with 
        attentive, family-centered care. Her areas of focus include preventive medicine, women’s health, and chronic condition management. When she’s not in the office, Dr. Fordham enjoys reading, relaxing by the coast, 
        and spending time with her family.
